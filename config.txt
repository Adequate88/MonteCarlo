# Configuration File for Statistical Study of Non-Linear Operators
# Provide inputs as instructed below.

# 1. Mathematical Expression
# Define the mathematical function f(x) to evaluate. Using valid syntax as referenced in README
# Example: f(x) = sin(x) + x^2
function_expression = x^2

# 2. Sampler Configuration
# Specify the random number generator to use. Choose one of the following:
# - inverse_transform_sampling
# - box_muller_transform
# - uniform_distribution
sampler_method = box_muller_transform

# 3. Number of Samples
# Enter the number of random samples to generate.
number_of_samples = 1000

# 4. Random Seed
# Provide an integer seed for the random number generator. 
# random_seed = 42

# 5. Histogram Configuration
# Provide the number of bins for the histogram (integer value).
# Set to 0 if you don't want a histogram to be drawn.
histogram_bins = 50

# 6. Compute Expectation Value
# Set to 'yes' if you want to compute the expectation value of f(x).
compute_expectation_value = yes

# 7. Statistical Moments
# Provide a comma-separated list of statistical moments to compute.
# Example: 1,2,3 (to compute the mean, variance, and skewness).
statistical_moments = 2,3,4

# 8. Central Limit Theorem Verification
# Set to 'yes' if you want to verify the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).
verify_central_limit_theorem = yes
# Specify a number of sample means to generate to test the CLT.
number_of_sample_means = 1000

# 9. Output Configuration
# Specify the name of the output file where results will be saved.
output_file = results.txt
